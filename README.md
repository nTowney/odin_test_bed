This is going to be a repository for all of my non-project related coding exercises.
------
I am going to try and stay up to date with my code-along exercises.

Journal entry, 11/20/23 - I'm not in a great mindspace right now, so I'm having a tough
time comprehending the current exercises. I am going to be studying more on the topics,
but I am not going to be making good progress in solving the exercises. I will continue
to make bullshit updates (like small css changes) to keep my streak alive, but nothing
with strong content.
