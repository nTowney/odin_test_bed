This is going to be a repository for all of my non-project related coding exercises.
------
I am going to try and stay up to date with my code-along exercises.

Journal entry, 11/20/23 - I'm not in a great mindspace right now, so I'm having a tough
time comprehending the current exercises. I am going to be studying more on the topics,
but I am not going to be making good progress in solving the exercises. I will continue
to make bullshit updates (like small css changes) to keep my streak alive, but nothing
with strong content.

Journal entry, 12/13/23 - Cyndi's grandma Angie was just admitted to the hospital today
with MRSA, she's 96 and the outlook so far isn't great... we spent a lot of time this
evening talking and spending time together, I will continue my study on the MDN article
for DOM manipulation tomorrow.
------
Journal entry, 12/14/23 - Angie was sent home from the hospital, apparently she's fine.
I'm taking my time reading through the MDN article, and once I'm done, I'll check out a
few YouTube tutorials as well. DOM manipulation is super important, so I want to make
sure I actually understand it and am not just manipulating someone else's code.
